# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a modern, responsive website for a fictional IT solutions company, W1IT. The site is built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS and is designed to be fully accessible, following WCAG 2.1 guidelines.

## Accessibility Enhancements

This blueprint documents the accessibility improvements made to the website. The following pages were reviewed and updated to ensure compliance with accessibility standards:

*   **Homepage:**
    *   Reviewed all images and icons to ensure they are decorative and do not require `alt` text. All essential information is conveyed through text.
*   **Services Pages:**
    *   Reviewed all `services` pages, including sub-pages, to ensure that all icons and images are decorative. No `alt` attributes are required, as all essential information is text-based.
*   **About Page:**
    *   Replaced placeholder images with more descriptive `alt` text to provide meaningful context for users of assistive technologies.
*   **Contact Page:**
    *   Added a `title` attribute to the `iframe` element to provide a descriptive title for the embedded map, making it more accessible to screen reader users.

## Implemented Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive and functions seamlessly on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** The design is clean, modern, and user-friendly, with a focus on intuitive navigation and clear calls-to-action.
*   **Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS:** The website is built with a modern, efficient, and scalable tech stack, ensuring optimal performance and maintainability.
